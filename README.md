🚦 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

📊 Overview

This project presents an interactive dashboard for analyzing road accident data across various parameters such as vehicle type, road conditions, weather, time, and location. The dashboard provides insights into accident trends, casualties, and contributing factors — helping policymakers, researchers, and analysts identify patterns and make data-driven decisions.

🧭 Project Objectives

Analyze casualties by year, road type, light conditions, and area (urban/rural).

Compare current year (CY) and previous year (PY) accident data.

Visualize accident distribution on a map for geographic insights.

Study the impact of weather and road surface conditions on accidents.

Identify the most affected vehicle types.

🧠 Insights

Majority of casualties occurred in urban areas (61.9%).

Cars account for the highest number of casualties (~155K).

Daylight conditions saw the majority of accidents (73.8%).

A year-over-year decrease in both accidents and casualties indicates improving road safety trends.
